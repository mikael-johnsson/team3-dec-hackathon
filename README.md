### **Goal**  
The **Goal** section provides a concise summary of the main objective or purpose of the project described in this README. It addresses the following aspects:  

- 🎄 **Problem Statement:** <br> When you think of an original advent calendar, you think of the one you purchase from your local shops and retail stores. You very rarely see a online, **interactive** advent calendar.   
- 🎄 **Objective(s):** <br> Users can interact with the calendar day to day, with each day allowing the user to interact with a new door. Each door provides it own **unique** content. Leading to a new <em>fun fact, riddle, joke or image related to Christmas</em>. The aim is to allow users to have fun while also counting down the days to Christmas.  
- 🎄 **Target Audience:** <br> Anyone who would like to experience a unique way to enjoy the countdown to Christmas and may not of had a chance to purchase a traditional advent calender. Just pop online and enjoy.
- 🎄 **Benefits:** <br>This project can be a **joyful** daily interaction for families, couples, youths to make for a fun festive way to count down the days to Christmas. Find a fun fact about Christmas, solve a Christmas riddle or have a festive laugh with a joke or two.
